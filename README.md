# Automate-File-Movement
This experimentation is a simple attempt to automate the file movement. A watchdog is utilized to watch over the Downloads folder. Whenever something is downloaded, it looks for the its extention, and automatically moves it to the respective folder. For example, if image1.jpg is downloaded, it will automatically transfer the image from the Downloads to the Images folder.
